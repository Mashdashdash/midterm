    <h2>Proposal</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>For my final project, I propose to create a website that focuses on the safety of street/urban design. With the rise of pedestrian and cycling fatalities, there has been a growing movement towards safer street design that prioritizes the needs of people outside of cars. This has led to the creation of various organizations and initiatives aimed at promoting safer street design. I want to help contribute to teaching those about how cities can be designed around those outside of cars. When I redesign a street my own way, I’ll base my data and numbers of people that are moving on that new street from StreetMix. 
    </p>
    <h3>Layout and Navigation</h3>
    <p>Upon entering the website, the user is greeted with a simple and clean design. The homepage features a large diagram image I'll create using a vector application of a typical street intersection layout cars dominating the road. With the press of a button, the user will be able to see the conflict points, areas where people/cars/bikes could collide during a normal traffic light cycle. With most intersections designed here in North America, there are a lot of conflict points. For pedestrians and bikes, crossing the street could be life or death. This shouldn't be normal, and streets should be designed around keeping everyone safe, not just making sure people can get to their destination quickly.  As the user scrolls down on the page, more is are added to the street to make it safer.
    </p>
    <p>	For example for a bikes, a bike path could be made into a protected one, the intersection could also be more protected, a small two way bike path could be made one way on each side of the street, and more. For streets that have cars that are meant to travel more quickly, the bike lanes should be paths that are completely separate from the the road. For more quiet streets through cities or towns, a protected one way bike path on each side would be better, as the lanes would be made smaller requiring vehicles to go more slowly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For pedestrians, the intersections of smaller streets could be made almost "invisible," with the use of raised crosswalks. These allow pedestrians to walk on a flat surface, and cars turning onto or from smaller streets would be required to stop and yield to people. Instead of pedestrians having to walk down a ramp that might have a puddle, and "bow" to the cars, instead the cars would be the ones that have to yield to those walking. Also, many streets in Europe have pedestrian refuge islands, normally in the median. This makes the road smaller for cars, requiring them to slow down, while also allowing people who walk more slowly a resting point when crossing. It also allows people to only need to look one way when crossing the street.
